# Quantum Simulation

This repository contains code for simulating quantum circuits using Cirq, a Python library for quantum computing.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/iris777vampyheks/Quantum-simulation.git

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
cd Quantum-simulation

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your machine before running the above command.

## Usage

1. Run the `quantum_simulation.py` script to simulate the quantum circuit:
python quantum_simulation.py


This script applies a square root of NOT gate to a qubit, measures the qubit, and simulates the circuit using Cirq. The measurement results will be displayed in the console.

Feel free to modify the script or create your own circuits using Cirq to explore quantum computing simulations.
